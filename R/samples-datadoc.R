#' Data from Norwegian port sampling program.
#'
#' Norwegian port sampling for Haddock landings in 2018 of fresh whitefish north of Lat 64, covering Jig, Gillnet, Longline, and Demershal Seining.
#' Sampling is implemented by a research vessel systematically sampling ports accepting fresh fish along the northern Norwegian coast.
#' Landings are almost exclusively day-catches located to small areas.
#' Vessels are intercepted during landing, and samples of up to 30 fish are taken stratified by gear and species.
#' Length, weight and age measured for all fish. Sex and maturity when presentation allows for it.
#' Weight of individual fish is reported as measured (presentation encoded in SApres), while total weight of landing and sample is converted to Whole-weight
#' using constant factors standardized by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries (See table 2.1 in \href{https://www.fiskeridir.no/Yrkesfiske/Tall-og-analyse/Omregningsfaktorer}{Conversion factors}. Document is mostly in Norwegian, but the relevant table is in English as well).
